# PsyX engine

PHP 2D game engine.

It is created on top of php-sdl2 library, so you need to install SDL2 libraries by yourself (`libSDL2, libSDL2_image, libSDL2_mixer, libSDL2_ttf`).
Also make sure that the FFI module is enabled in your PHP configuration.

Tested under Linux only.

Projects made with the engine:
- https://github.com/alxmrz/deminer - a clone of Minesweeper
- https://github.com/alxmrz/phpacman - a clone of Pac-man
